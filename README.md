# Why
The idea for WanderList came to me while I was on vacation in Dubai. It struck me how challenging it was to keep track of all the destinations I wanted to visit. That's when I realized the need for an app that could store all my desired destinations I want to visit while I was on vacation.

**NB.** The app is still under development. Awesome features enroute.

# Requirement
The main requirements that I had in mind was:
- Should be able to add multiple location under a single vaction.
- The locations should be plotted on a map.
- Access to a brief description of each location upon clicking.
- Clean UI with smooth animations.
